Requests Client
***************

Library that expands upon `Requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ to provide an easy way to build
multiple requests to a given server, without needing to provide the full URL for every request.  This is especially
useful for working with RESTful applications with multiple backends, where a common endpoint is requested from each
backend.
